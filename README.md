# Stopwatch App

**Project Overview:**

This Stopwatch App was developed as part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The app is built using Flutter and features a dynamic, real-time animated circle that reflects the progress of the stopwatch. It includes functionalities to start, pause, and reset the timer, with a clean and responsive user interface.

**Key Features:**

- **Live Animated Circle:** Visual representation of time progression with a circle that animates as time increases.
- **Custom Layout:** Time displayed prominently within the animated circle, with an intuitive and user-friendly design.
- **Responsive Design:** Adjusted layout to ensure optimal placement of time and buttons for an enhanced user experience.

**What I Learned:**

- **Flutter Animation:** Gained experience in implementing real-time animations to reflect stopwatch progress.
- **Custom Painting:** Learned how to use `CustomPainter` for drawing and animating UI components.
- **UI/UX Design:** Focused on designing a visually appealing and functional interface.
